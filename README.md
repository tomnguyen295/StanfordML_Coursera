# StanfordML_Coursera
All the programming assignments done for Stanford's Machine Learning course on Coursera, taught by Andrew Yang

- Ex1 - Simple application of linear regression. Includes implementation of vanilla gradient descent with feature normalization. Also includes implementation of normal equation method
- Ex2 - Simple application of logistic regression for binary classification. Includes implementation of vanilla gradient descent with regularization applied. Uses sigmoid activation function for the cost function
- Ex3 - Includes implementation of one-vs-all logistic regression and forward propagation of neural networks to classify hand-written digits
- Ex4 - Continues neural network implementation, adding backpropagation to classify hand-written digits
- Ex5 - Looks at how to handle bias and variance in models for regularized linear regression. Analyzing learning curves using different hyperparameters and different levels of polynomial regression
- Ex6 - Includes implementation of SVMs (support vector machines) for building a spam classifier. Uses gaussian kernel for SVM
- Ex7 - Includes implementation of K-means clustering algorithm for image compression. Also includes implementation of PCA (principal component analysis) for dimensionality reduction, applied onto an image dataset of faces
- Ex8 - Includes implementation of anomaly detection algorithm for detecting failing servers on a network. Also includes usage of collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies

All programming assignments are written in MATLAB
